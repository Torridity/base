composed of
+
--
- five buttons, each representing a menu item leading to a special AdminUI 
content view
- a blank placeholder for tooltips appearing whenever the mouse pointer hovers
over one of the five menu items
- a placeholder displaying the full name of the logged-in-user
- a combo box showing the <<ChapterActiveRole,active role>>, one group in which
the logged-is-user is member of.
--

`BODY`:: The body changes dependent on the menu item selected by the logged-in-user. 
In the following the different body views are specified:
+
--
<<ChapterProfile,image:Profile_Button.png[Profile_Button, width="45"]>>  Profile

context, shortly your authorization context, is mainly determinded by the role you possess within the active group 
selected via the combo box on the right-hand side of the AdminUI's <<ChapterViews,menu bar>>.

_Example_::
By selecting a group as active group, in which you have been declared group manager, 
you are authorized to perform actions only executable by group managers, e.g. view and modify parts of the 
<<ChapterSettings,image:Settings_Button.png[Settings_Button, width="30"] KIT Data Manager Settings>>.

[[ChapterProfile]]
Profile
^^^^^^^

The profile-view, displayed by clicking the menu item image:Profile_Button.png[Profile_Button, width="30"], 
offers you a basic overview of your activities as KIT Data Manager user. The 
table, for example, compares the amount of resources currently accessible by you 
with the total amount of generally available resources, i.d. you get to 
know at a glance
[disc]
- the number of user groups you are currently member of compared to the total 
amount of available user groups
- the number of digital objects currently accessible by 
you compared to the total amount of available digital objects
- the number of files collected in digital objects currently accessible by you 
compared to the total amount of available files
- the data amount of digital objects currently accessible by you compared to the
total data amount of available digital objects.

[[ChapterSiMon]]
SiMon - SimpleMonitoring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

image::SiMon.png[SiMon, align="center"]

SiMon offers a simple and configurable service monitoring. For this purpose different so called `Probes` can be defined. 
By default, there are four different probe types:

[horizontal]
`edu.kit.dama.ui.simon.impl.MountProbe`:: This probe can be used to check the availability of mount points. It checks whether to 
configured location is readable and writable. See `$KITDM_LOCATION/simon/MOUNT.properties' for an example.

`edu.kit.dama.ui.simon.impl.RestServiceProbe`:: This probe checks the availability of a RESTful service. Therefore, the service URL 
and an unsecured service method must be provided. If the method returns HTTP 200 the probe succeeds. See `$KITDM_LOCATION/simon/REST.properties' 
for an example.

`edu.kit.dama.ui.simon.impl.WebServerProbe`:: This probe simply tries to connect to a Web Server behind a specified URL. If the call succeeds within the provided timeout, the probe 
also succeeds. See `$KITDM_LOCATION/simon/WEBSERVER.properties' for an example.

`edu.kit.dama.ui.simon.impl.ShellScriptProbe`:: This probe should cover all other scenarios as it allows to execute an arbitrary shell script. If the shell script finishes with the exit code 0 
the probe succeeds. See `$KITDM_LOCATION/simon/SCRIPT.properties' for an example.

You can also create own probes by implementing `edu.kit.dama.ui.simon.impl.AbstractProbe` and placing the Jar file containing your probe class at 
`$KITDM_LOCATION/KITDM/WEB-INF/lib` Please refer to the JavaDoc for detailed information.

[[ChapterSettings]]

[[ChapterExecutionEnvironments]]
Execution Environments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the execution environment tab of the <<ChapterSettings,settings-view>> so called execution environments for data workflow tasks 
can be defined and configured. Basically, an execution environment is defined by a handler class taking care of task execution and 
monitoring. To allow providing data for the task execution each execution environment is linked to an access point that can be 
used by the repository system to stage data into the computing environment and out of it. Therefor, repository system and computing 
environment must share a storage resource which they both can access locally, e.g. via mount point.

Creating new execution environment is done using the execution-environment-tab 
selectable in the <<ChapterSettings,settings-view>>:

Create New Execution Environment:: For creating a new execution environment, select the item
`NEW` from the left-hand container `AVAILABLE ELEMENTS`. The selection enables 
both, the upper text field `ENVIRONMENT HANDLER IMPLEMENTATION CLASS` and the button 
image:ImplementationClass_Button.png[ImplementationClass_Button]; contemporary 
the lower part of the form, designed for declaring the properties of a execution environment,
is disabled. For proceeding, enter the fully qualified class name of the implementation class that 
shall be used for creating the new execution environment before clicking 
image:ImplementationClass_Button.png[ImplementationClass_Button].
+
In case of a successfully created execution environment, the remaining form is enabled, 
permitting the further configuration of the newly created execution environment. Now, declare 
all remaining properties and commit the changes to the execution environment by clicking the button `Commit Changes`. 
In addition, `ENVIRONMENT PROPERTIES` can be defined allowing a more detailed description of the execution environment. 
These properties can be used later on to decide whether a workflow task, which requires a set of `ENVIRONMENT PROPERTIES` 
from a common pool of properties, can be executed using a particular execution environment or not. However, there is currently 
no mechanism to validate whether these properties contain any meaningful value or if e.g. a `Software-Map-Property` describes a 
software which is physically available in the execution environment the property is assigned to.

[[ChapterDataWorkflowTasks]]
Data Workflow Tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A data workflow task describes a single task that can be executed alone or in a chain of multiple tasks. In contrast to other elements configured in the settings-view, 
a basic versioning is applied to data workflow tasks. Changing the `TASK NAME`, the `PACKAGE URL`
or the `ARGUMENTS` will result in a new workflow task (in case of changing the name) or to a new task version (in case of changing the package url or arguments). 
All other fields can be changed without any effect to the task version.

Creating data workflow task is done using the data-workflow-tasks-tab selectable in the <<ChapterSettings,settings-view>>:

Create New Data Workflow Task:: For creating a new data workflow task, select the item
`NEW` from the left-hand container `AVAILABLE ELEMENTS`. Fill all fields according to your task properties and requirements. `PACKAGE_URL` should be in the form
`file://<ZIP_LOCATION_ON_LOCAL_FILESYSTEM>`. Optionally, you can provide `ENVIRONMENT PROPERTIES` that have to be provided by an execution environment in order 
to execute the task. Please refer to the <<ChapterExecutionEnvironments,according section>> for more details. Finally, after committing the changed, the workflow task is 
registered and can be linked to digital objects using the according REST service or Java API.

View/Modify Existing Data Workflow Tasks:: For viewing or modifying the configuration
of an already declared data workflow task, select the corresponding data workflow task
from the left-hand container `AVAILABLE ELEMENTS`. A valid selection 
enables all components of changeable data-workflow-task-properties. Finalize your changes 
by clicking the button `Commit Changes`.

[[DataWorkflowTaskConfiguration]]

[horizontal]
`AVAILABLE_ELEMENTS`:: Container listing all defined data workflow tasks.

`TASK_NAME`:: Text field to display the unique task name. Changing the name of an existing task will result in creating a new task in version 1 with the same properties as the existing task.

`VERSION`:: Text field to display the version number of the task. The version number increases if any of the unchangeable field of a task, e.g. application URL or arguments, is changed. 
It is not allowed to modify the version number manually.

`CONTACT_USERID`:: Text field displaying the userId of the contact user of the workflow task, e.g. for application support. This userId must be a valid userId registered in the repository system.

`PACKAGE_URL`:: Text field displaying the package URL where the application zip archive is located. This URL must be in the format `file://<LOCAL_PATH>`, e.g. `file:///usr/share/apps/MyApp-1.0.zip`.

`ARGUMENTS`:: Text field displaying the application arguments which are appended to each application execution. Beware that these arguments cannot be changed for a workflow task. Changing the arguments
results in creating a new version of the task.

`KEYWORDS`:: Text area displaying a set of space separated keywords that might be used to search for a particular workflow task.

`DESCRIPTION`:: Text area displaying additional information with respect to the selected workflow task.

`Default`:: Check box for setting the selected workflow task as default task, e.g. to be applied by default to ingested digital objects. Currently, this flag is not actively used.

`Disabled`:: Check box for disabling the selected workflow task.

`ENVIRONMENT_PROPERTIES`:: A twin columns list allowing to select environment properties required by the workflow task. A button next to the list allows to add new properties.

`Commit Changes`:: Button for committing the changed configuration of the selected workflow task or to create a new task/a new version of the task if unchangeable fields have changed. 

[[ChapterJobScheduling]]
Job Scheduling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The job scheduling is a new feature introduced in KIT Data Manager 1.2 allowing to 
configure and execute recurring jobs in a seamlessly integrated, platform independent
way. Basically, the job scheduling is a replacement for setting up Cron jobs for jobs
like data staging, metadata indexing or workflow execution.

Creating new job and scheduling their execution is provided by the job-scheduling-tab 
selectable in the <<ChapterSettings,settings-view>>:

Create New Job Schedule:: For creating a new job schedule, select the item
`NEW` from the left-hand container `AVAILABLE ELEMENTS`. The selection enables 
both, the upper text field `ENVIRONMENT HANDLER IMPLEMENTATION CLASS` and the button 
image:ImplementationClass_Button.png[ImplementationClass_Button]; contemporary 
the lower part of the form, designed for declaring the properties of a job schedule,
is disabled. For proceeding, enter the fully qualified class name of the implementation class that 
shall be used for creating the new job schedule before clicking 
image:ImplementationClass_Button.png[ImplementationClass_Button].

In case of a successfully created job schedule, the remaining form is enabled, 
permitting the further configuration of the newly created job schedule. Declare 
all remaining properties (except `TRIGGERS`) and persist the job schedule by clicking the button `Commit Changes`. 
Finally, in order to trigger the job execution, one or more triggers have to be assigned to the job. Click the 
add button next to the trigger table. In the popup which opens there are four different triggers available:

[cols="m,n", options="header"]
|============================================================================================================================
|Trigger|Description
|'Now' Trigger|Triggers a immediate, single-time job execution. After the execution, the trigger is removed again.
|'At' Trigger|Triggers a single-time job execution at a specific time. After the execution, the trigger is removed again.
|'Expression' Trigger|Triggers a repeated job execution specified in a Cron-like syntax.
|'Interval' Trigger|Triggers a repreated job execution in a specific interval in seconds and with an optional number of times.
|============================================================================================================================

For typical use cases it is recommended to use either 'Expression' or 'Interval' triggers as they typically run as long as they are not removed manually.
'Now' and 'At' triggers are bound to a specific time, would disappear afterwards and the according job won't be triggered any longer.
