Installing KIT Data Manager
---------------------------

The following sections describe the basic installation steps of KIT Data Manager. After following the installation instructions you'll have all available KIT Data Manager 
services deployed in a Tomcat environment accessible via REST interfaces. Everything beyond, e.g. graphical user interfaces or advanced deployment scenarios, are not 
part of this documentation.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to be able to provide KIT Data Manager services you'll need at least the following software components installed: 

* Java SE Development Kit 7
* Apache Tomcat 7
* PostgreSQL 9.1
* Apache Http Server (for sample WebDAV access to data)

In principal it is possible to install KIT Data Manager on every operating system. For simplicity, this documentation only covers the installation on a Unix-based system 
(namely Ubuntu 14.04 LTS) in detail.

Software Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At first, please install the required software packages. Therefor, you can use either the package manager of your system or you can download the packages manually. 
The following steps are based on an installation using Apt:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
user@localhost:/home/user$ sudo apt-get install postgresql
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
postgresql is already the newest version.
user@localhost:/home/user$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
openjdk-7-jdk is already the newest version.
user@localhost:/home/user$ sudo apt-get install tomcat7
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
tomcat7 is already the newest version.
user@localhost:/home/user$ sudo apt-get install apache2 apache2-utils
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
apache2 is already the newest version.
user@localhost:/home/user$
--------------------------------------
Now you have installed all software packages you need to run KIT Data Manager. Not later than now you should extract your KIT Data Manager binary distribution archive 
to a preferred location which will be referred below as `$KITDM_LOCATION`. Afterwards change the ownership to tomcat7:tomcat7. 

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
user@localhost:/home/user$ cd $KITDM_LOCATION
user@localhost:/home/user$ unzip KITDM-<Version>.zip
user@localhost:/home/user$ sudo chown tomcat7:tomcat7 KITDM
user@localhost:/home/user$
--------------------------------------

There should now be the application itself and a number of configuration files and scripts, which are covered later, available at $KITDM_LOCATION. 
In the following steps the relational database used by KIT Data Manager is prepared. The first step is setting a password for the database user that was created 
during installation.

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
user@localhost:/home/user$ sudo -u postgres psql postgres
psql (9.1.13)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#\password postgres
--------------------------------------

Now set a password for the database user `postgres` and keep it in mind for later configuration steps. Now the KIT Data Manager database can be created. 

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
user@localhost:/home/user$ sudo -u postgres createdb datamanager
user@localhost:/home/user$ 
--------------------------------------

A database named `datamanager` has been created and can be set up. For this purpose, a file named `$KITDM_LOCATION/sql/schema.sql` is provided as part of your KIT Data 
Manager distribution. Apply the SQL statements in this file to the database by the following command:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
user@localhost:/home/user$ sudo -u postgres psql -U postgres -d datamanager -f $KITDM_LOCATION/sql/schema.sql
SET
SET
SET
SET
SET
CREATE EXTENSION
[...]
user@localhost:/home/user$ 
--------------------------------------

Finally, the database has to be filled with some basic data in order to access KIT Data Manager later for the first time. This basic sample data is stored in the file 
`$KITDM_LOCATION/sql/sampledata.sql`. Before you continue you may modify this file according to your needs. Afterwards, add all data stored in this file to the database 
by the following command: 

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
user@localhost:/home/user$ sudo -u postgres psql -U postgres -d datamanager -f $KITDM_LOCATION/sql/sampledata.sql
SET
SET
SET
SET
SET
SET
INSERT 0 1
[...]
user@localhost:/home/user$ 
--------------------------------------

In the next step you have to deploy the KIT Data Manager Web application on the local Tomcat server. Therefor, copy the file `$KITDM_LOCATION/webapp/KITDM.xml` to 
`$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost`. In our case this would be `/var/lib/tomcat7/conf/Catalina/localhost/`. 

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
user@localhost:/home/user$ sudo cp $KITDM_LOCATION/webapp/KITDM.xml /var/lib/tomcat7/conf/Catalina/localhost/
user@localhost:/home/user$ 
--------------------------------------

Finally, you have to modify `/var/lib/tomcat7/conf/Catalina/localhost/KITDM.xml` in order to make `KITDM_LOCATION` point to the absolute value of `$KITDM_LOCATION`. The appended path component `KITDM` should exist and points
to the folder containing the actual web application.
Now, your KIT Data Manager services are ready for further configuration.

Basic Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All configuration files of KIT Data Manager are located inside the web application folder, by default at `$KITDM_LOCATION/KITDM/WEB-INF/classes/`. Relevant configuration files are: 

META-INF/persistence.xml::
   Contains all JPA persistence units for database access. Values that must be changed are `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`.
datamanager.xml::
   Contains all KIT Data Manager settings. Typically, most of them can remain unchanged, except settings containing placeholder variables (e.g. `KITDM_LOCATION`, `HOSTNAME` and `ARCHIVE_STORAGE`). Please refer to the comments
   in the config file for more information.
logback.xml::
   The configuration of the logging framework. By default, all warnings and error messages are logged into the Tomcat temp folder located at `/tmp/tomcat7-tomcat7-tmp/`, 
   but you can also set another value instead of `${java.io.tmpdir}/datamanager.log` as log file location at any time.

[NOTE]
Please go through all files at least during your first installation to check which settings are in there and which you have to change in order to get your KIT Data Manager instance running.

In order to be able to use KIT Data Manager as a repository system, at least one access point must be configured to allow data ingest and download. From KIT Data Manager 1.2 there are two options: 

1. Use the included Tomcat WebDav servlet.
2. Use WebDav provided by a web server, e.g. an Apache HTTP server.

The first option is way easier to setup as there is no need for an additional service and there is no need to cope with any access permission issues as the servlet is running as the same user as the
KIT Data Manager instance. However, there are also drawbacks, e.g. is it awkward to add new WebDav users as they have to be added to the tomcat-users.xml file and Tomcat has to be restarted to
apply the changes. 
Using a separate service, e.g. provided by an Apache HTTP server, allows to secure the access using HTTPS, to integrate LDAP authentification and it provides much more flexibility. Therefore, it is 
recommended to use the second option for production environments.

Setting up a WebDav Access Point using the Tomcat WebDav Servlet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Setting up the Tomcat WebDav servlet is basically quite easy as almost everything comes with the default KIT Data Manager distribution. 

The first step is to deploy the servlet in Tomcat. Therefore, just copy the folder 'webdav' which is located at `$KITDM_LOCATION` to `$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps`. Afterwards, a WebDav user has to be added in order
to allow access. Therefor, the file `$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml` has to be modified as follows:

[source, xml]
--------------------------------------
<tomcat-users>
   <!--[...]-->
   <role rolename="webdav"/>
   <user username="webdav" password="webdav" roles="webdav"/>
</tomcat-users>
--------------------------------------

These entries are adding a WebDav role, defined in `$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/webdav/WEB-INF/web.xml`, which is allowed to access to WebDav servlet. Furthermore, a user owning the WebDav role is added. The username 
`webdav` and the password `webdav` can be chosen arbitrarily. After restarting the Tomcat server the WebDav servlet should be accessible. 

The final step is now to register a new staging access point using WebDav access. Therefore, please proceed to <<AnchorAPRegistration,the end of the next chapter>> and follow these final instructions.


Setting up a WebDav Access Point using an Apache HTTP server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Apache Http server package has been already installed in the first step of this installation instruction. Therefore, the following section only covers the setup of WebDav.

The first step is setting up WebDav starting with enabling the WebDav modules:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
user@localhost:/home/user$ sudo a2enmod dav
Enabling module dav.
user@localhost:/home/user$ sudo a2enmod dav_fs
Enabling module dav_fs.
user@localhost:/home/user$
--------------------------------------

The next step is creating a user database file containing all authorized WebDav users. You may replace the username `webdav` by a username of your choice.

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
user@localhost:/home/user$ sudo htpasswd -c /etc/apache2/dav_users.db webdav
New password: 
Re-type new password: 
Adding password for user webdav
user@localhost:/home/user$ sudo chgrp www-data /etc/apache2/dav_users.db
user@localhost:/home/user$
--------------------------------------

This step may be executed multiple times if multiple accounts should be allowed to ingest files via WebDav. However, in production environments more sophisticated setups using 
e.g. LDAP for authentication are recommended. 

The following steps are relatively complex, Linux distribution-dependent and might not be necessary in every case. The challenge to solve is, that by default there is one 
user running Tomcat (tomcat7 by default) and another user running the Apache Http server (www-data by default), both in groups with the same names. For data transfer tasks
KIT Data Manager running in Tomcat has to create the destination folders which are filled via (ingest) or for (download) WebDav transfers afterwards. Hence, all files must 
be accessible by both users, tomcat7 and www-data. Of course, the most simple solution is to run Tomcat and Apache Http server by the same user, but this is not feasible in 
many cases and may cause security issues. Therefore, in the following lines another setup based on group permissions will be presented.

At first, the folder which will be accessible via WebDav is created and proper permissions are assigned.

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
user@localhost:/home/user$ sudo mkdir /var/www/webdav
user@localhost:/home/user$ sudo chgrp www-data /var/www/webdav
user@localhost:/home/user$ sudo chmod 2770 /var/www/webdav
--------------------------------------

Now, the folder `/var/www/webdav` is owned by the group `www-data`, has full access for the owner and the owner's group and has the group sticky bit set, which takes care 
that the group ownership is applied to all files and folders created below `/var/www/webdav/`. Apart from the ownership also access permissions have to be kept for newly 
created files and folders. For this purpose `umask` is used. Applying a umask for the Apache process under Ubuntu is done quite easyby adding `umask 007` at the 
end of `/etc/apache2/envvars`, either manually or by using the following call: 

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
user@localhost:/home/user$ echo 'umask 007' | sudo tee --append /etc/apache2/envvars
umask 007
user@localhost:/home/user$
--------------------------------------

Please check afterwards, if the line was added and if it is the only entry setting the umask. Afterwards, permissions 770 will be assigned to all files and folders 
created by the Apache process providing WebDav access. Finally, both users (the one running Tomcat and the one running the Apache Http server) must be in the same group, 
in our case `www-data` is used. Therefore, the user running Tomcat has to be added to `www-data` in order to complete the setup: 

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
user@localhost:/home/user$ sudo adduser tomcat7 www-data
Adding user tomcat7 to group www-data
Done.
user@localhost:/home/user$
--------------------------------------

Finally, you have to configure WebDav in Apache. Therefor, please add the following section to the configuration `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf`: 

[source,xml]
--------------------------------------
<VirtualHost *:80>  
  //[...]
  Alias /webdav "/var/www/webdav/"

  <Directory "/var/www/webdav/">
    DAV on
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName WebDav
    AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/dav_users.db
    Require valid-user
    AllowOverride none 
  </Directory>
  //[...]
</VirtualHost>
--------------------------------------

All these changes take effect after restarting Tomcat and Apache Http server. 

The final part of the system-level portion of the setup is the execution of regularly executed tasks taking care of performing e.g. staging operations to/from the repository managed storage. 
In order to register and execute these tasks it is recommended to use the internal job scheduler which can be configured using the administration backend of KIT Data Manager. 
Please refer to the <<ChapterJobScheduling,according section>> for details. 

An alternative option is creating a Cron job using the provided script called `TransferFinalizer.sh` available at 
`$KITDM_LOCATION/scripts/`. At first, set the correct value of $KITDM_LOCATION in the script. Then, please pay attention that the scripts are executed by the user running 
the KIT Data Manager Web application, in our case this should be `tomcat7`. Therefore, the Cron job must be assigned to this user as follows:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
user@localhost:/home/user$ sudo -u tomcat7 crontab -e
#Press i to enter insert mode and put the following lines at the end.#
##Modify the the base path $KITDM_LOCATION according to your local setup!##

*/5 * * * * $KITDM_LOCATION/scripts/TransferFinalizer.sh -t DOWNLOAD > /dev/null 2>&1
*/10 * * * * $KITDM_LOCATION/scripts/TransferFinalizer.sh -t INGEST > /dev/null 2>&1

#Press ESC for leaving the insert mode and press :wq to save and quit
user@localhost:/home/user$
--------------------------------------

[WARNING]
Don't forget to set $KITDM_LOCATION inside the TransferFinalizer.sh script when using this option for executing recurring jobs. Otherwise, all staging operations will fail.
[[AnchorAPRegistration]]
Now, a new access point using the created WebDav service can be registered using the administration backend of KIT Data Manager. For this purpose please browse to
`http://localhost:8080/KITDM` in the browser of your KIT Data Manager machine and login. By default the administrator email is `dama@kit.edu` and the password is `dama14`. 
Open the settings page using the button on the lower left hand side and select the tab `Staging Access Point Configuration`, which looks as follows:

[[AdminUI_AP]]
.Staging access point configuration tab in the administration backend.
image::AdminUI_AP.png[AdminUI_AP]

At first, insert `edu.kit.dama.staging.ap.impl.BasicStagingAccessPoint` as access point Implementation Class. Clicking the button next to the input fields will create
a new access point. Now, please insert all values as shown in the screenshot in order to configure the access point properly. Pay special attention to the Remote Base URL, 
which has to correspond to the FQDN of your machine running KIT Data Manager. 

[NOTE]
If the Tomcat Servlet-based WebDav access is used the `LOCAL BASE PATH` must be set to `$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/webdav` where `$TOMCAT_HOME` has to be replaced according to your local Tomcat installation location.

Finally, commit all changes using the Commit button on the lower right. 
Now, you should be able to use KIT Data Manager as a repository system including the ingest and the download of data.

Updating KIT Data Manager
-------------------------

The effort for updating from one KIT Data Manager version to another mainly depends on how KIT Data Manager is used and customized. A typical update process of a standard installation 
described earlier in this documentation includes the following steps:

1. Stop the Tomcat container in which KIT Data Manager is running
2. Create a backup of $KITDM_LOCATION and the database
3. Update the KIT Data Manager libraries
4. Update database schema and/or settings if required 
5. Rebuild and redeploy all additionally added, custom libraries (*)
6. Restart the Tomcat container

(*) Step 5 is optional and will be described in section <<SectionCustomUpdate,Update Custom Libraries>>.

The following detailed description for updating a KIT Data Manager installation is based on Ubuntu. 
If you are using another distribution some commands and service names might be slightly different. Also the username and database name used by the pg_dump command 
might be different depending on how your KIT Data Manager instance is configured.

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
user@localhost:/home/user$ sudo service tomcat7 stop
* Stopping Tomcat servlet engine tomcat7
user@localhost:/home/user$ cd $KITDM_LOCATION
user@localhost:/home/user$ mkdir ../backup_1.0
user@localhost:/home/user$ cp * ../backup_1.0 -R
user@localhost:/home/user$ sudo -u postgres pg_dump -U postgres -h localhost -d datamanager -W > ../backup_1.0/database_dump.sql
user@localhost:/home/user$
--------------------------------------

In the next step, the libraries of your KIT Data Manager installation have to be updated. If you are updating from KIT Data Manager version 1.0 please download the update package 
KITDM-Update-<VERSION>.zip to `$KITDM_LOCATION` and continue as follows:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
user@localhost:/home/user$ rm KITDM/WEB-INF/lib/*.jar 
user@localhost:/home/user$ rm KITDM/WEB-INF/classes/edu/kit/dama/ -R
user@localhost:/home/user$ unzip KITDM-Update-<VERSION>.zip
user@localhost:/home/user$ 
--------------------------------------

In the first two steps, all libraries and classes of the old version are deleted. This is necessary due to the fact, that a library named `Authorization-1.0.jar` would be favored 
by the classloader even if there is a new version named `Authorization-1.1.jar`. Afterwards, by extracting `KITDM-Update-<VERSION>.zip` all libraries of version <VERSION> are placed 
directly at `$KITDM_LOCATION/KITDM/WEB-INF/lib/`.

Since KIT Data Manager 1.2 there is an update tool offering support for the process of updating libraries from one version to another. You'll find the tool under 
`$KITDM_LOCATION/scripts/LibraryCompare.sh`. The tool allows you to compare the contents of a library folder of an old installation with the contents of a library folder of a 
new installation. The differences can be printed out to StdOut or written into a script that can be used to merge both library folders. However, it is highly recommended to backup the 
old library folder before applying the update script. Please refer to the command line help of the script for further information. 

After updating all core libraries there might be additional steps necessary, e.g. applying database schema or configuration file changes. Necessary steps are described for each
new version in section <<SectionChanges,Additional Update Steps>>. If you skip one or more versions you typically have to apply all intermediate steps unless the documentation 
states something different.

[[SectionCustomUpdate]]
Update Custom Libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As soon as you've started integrating community-specific features into the basic repository system, the question arises, how these customizations are carried from one version to the other.
Basically, this is quite simple. At first, it is highly recommended to rebuild all customizations, e.g. Staging Processors or custom metadata entities, against the current version of 
KIT Data Manager in order to detect the use of deprecated interfaces or updated imports. Afterwards, all custom libraries can be placed at `$KITDM_LOCATION/KITDM/WEB-INF/lib/` again and 
should work as before. If this can not be expected, e.g. due to internal changes, an according remark will be stated in the following chapter.

[[SectionChanges]]
Additional Update Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following section contains additional update steps necessary in order to update from different versions of KIT Data Manager to the next. There are different types of updates: 

image:data.png[DatabaseUpdate] Database schema changes

image:gear_preferences.png[ConfigurationUpdate] Configuration file changes 

image:server_client_exchange.png[InterfaceUpdate] REST Interface changes

For database changes (image:data.png[DatabaseUpdate]) typically an SQL update script is provided that has to be executed using the following command:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
user@localhost:/home/user$ sudo -u postgres psql -U postgres -W -h localhost -d datamanager -f $KITDM_LOCATION/sql/update.1.0-1.1.sql
user@localhost:/home/user$
--------------------------------------

Of course you should use the username and database name fitting your KIT Data Manager installation. Also the name of the update script will change depending on the affected versions.

Please refer to the following section for all changes, whether applying them is optional or not and their side effects:

[underline]*Update 1.0 -> 1.1*

[cols="1,1,6,2", options="header"]
|============================================================================================================================
|Type|Optional|Todo|Side Effects
|image:data.png[DatabaseUpdate]|No|Apply script `sql/update.1.0-1.1.sql`|All ingest- and downloadinformation entries are deleted. Therefor, it is recommended to finish all data transfers before updating.
|image:gear_preferences.png[ConfigurationUpdate]|Yes|Add nodes for *maxIngestLifetime* and *maxDownloadLifetime* to *staging* section 
in `$KITDM_LOCATION/KITDM/WEB-INF/classes/datamanager.xml` The default value is 604800 (seconds per week).|None.
|============================================================================================================================

[underline]*Update 1.1 -> 1.2*

[cols="1,1,6,2", options="header"]
|============================================================================================================================
|Type|Optional|Todo|Side Effects
|image:data.png[DatabaseUpdate]|No|Apply script `sql/update.1.1-1.2.sql`|This script adds the Quartz scheduler related tables to the database. Furthermore, a typo was fixed and an additional column to the table 'ExecutionEnvironmentConfiguration' was introduced. As the worklflow service was not publicly available before version 1.2 this table should not exists, yet. Therefor, error related to changing this table can be safely ignored.
|image:gear_preferences.png[ConfigurationUpdate]|No|Add a new section *scheduler* containing setting for the internal scheduler feature.|None.
|============================================================================================================================

Additional section that has to be added to datamanger.xml in order to configure the Quartz scheduler. The values of the job store have to be changed according to your local configuration:

[source, xml]
--------------------------------------
<config>
   <!--[...]-->
   </staging>
   <scheduler>
     <!--Connection information for the JobStore used to hold information about scheduled jobs. Typically, the same information also used
         in the persistence.xml can be applied here in order to keep everything together in one place.-->
     <jobStoreConnectionDriver>org.postgresql.Driver</jobStoreConnectionDriver>
     <jobStoreConnectionString>jdbc:postgresql://DB_HOST:DB_PORT/DB_NAME</jobStoreConnectionString>
     <jobStoreUser>DB_USER</jobStoreUser>
     <jobStorePassword>DB_PASSWORD</jobStorePassword>
     <!--Wait for running tasks if the scheduler is shutting down, e.g. due to shutting down the application server. default: true-->
     <waitOnShutdown>true</waitOnShutdown>
     <!--Delay in seconds before the scheduler starts the execution of tasks. This delay is useful as services needed to perform tasks
         may not be running, yet, when the scheduler starts. The default value is 5 seconds.-->
     <startDelaySeconds>5</startDelaySeconds>
      <!--Add default schedules during the first startup of the scheduler. These schedules are executing transfer finalization 
          (ingest/download) every 60/30 seconds. The default value is true.-->
     <addDefaultSchedules>true</addDefaultSchedules>
   </scheduler>
</config>
--------------------------------------
