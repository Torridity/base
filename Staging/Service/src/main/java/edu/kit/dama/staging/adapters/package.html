    <p>Adapter implementations that can be configured and used within the StagingService. These Adapters are intended to be used to configure how and where related service are 
    accessed. In the default scenario all services needed for Staging (Ingest-/DownloadInformationService, StorageVirtualization and DataOrganization) are located on the same 
    machine within the same virtual machine and can be accessed directly. In more sophisticated use cases, e.g. the StorageVirtualization could access external storage services
    that might be located on a remote site and need special configuration. In this case a new StorageVirtualizationAdapter would be necessary.</p>
